# Predicting current seasonâ€™s NBA match outcomes using Feedforward Neural Networks

Please [refer here](https://github.com/raniaspant/NBApredictions/blob/master/ECE%20572%20Neural%20Networks%20Term%20Project%20Report.pdf) for more information and how the architecture was implemented. :)

It is basically a simple feed forward NN architecture using Keras deep learning library in Python. The whole project was developed in PyCharm with the preparation of the data through [this](https://github.com/raniaspant/stats-scraping) script.
